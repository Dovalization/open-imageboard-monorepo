# **OpenBoard: Project Vision**

## Context

OpenBoard addresses a critical challenge in the evolving digital landscape: the need for communities to control and govern their own platforms for discourse and organization. Today, centralized platforms like Reddit, Twitter/X, and Discord dominate online communication. These services often impose arbitrary moderation policies, manipulate behavior, collect user data, and prioritize engagement and monetization over user autonomy or well-being.

In contrast, many communities—especially those centered around niche interests, anonymity, or countercultural ideas—seek spaces that reflect their values. These groups require platforms that are easy to self-host, designed with privacy in mind, supportive of anonymous participation, and flexible enough to accommodate diverse moderation and interaction styles. OpenBoard is being built to meet those needs.

## Proposal

OpenBoard is a modular discussion platform that draws inspiration from traditional message boards, image boards, and forums. It is optimized for fast, ephemeral communication using thread-based discussions. Unlike many modern platforms emphasizing identity and algorithmic feeds, OpenBoard emphasizes simplicity, speed, and user autonomy.

A core tenet of OpenBoard is anonymity. Users are not required to create accounts to participate. They can post anonymously, use pseudonymous usernames, or optionally authenticate using OAuth. The moderation system is equally flexible, designed around granular, role-based permissions, audit logging, and per-board governance. Each board operates as an independent community with rules, moderators, and participation norms.

From a systems architecture perspective, OpenBoard is a self-hostable platform built with a modular monolith design. It uses Docker for straightforward deployment and relies on clear API boundaries to ensure maintainability and extensibility. This foundation allows for rapid iteration and the faster introduction of new features. All components are developed with composability in mind.

## Consequences

The project’s emphasis on decentralization and user-led governance informs every aspect of its design. OpenBoard focuses on empowering communities with tools to define their own structures. Each board is treated as a sovereign entity with independent moderation policies, access controls, and feature configurations.

This requires a flexible technical architecture that supports per-board customization, including settings for content moderation, authentication methods, and user roles. It also drives product decisions that favor simplicity, transparency, and user control over top-down enforcement or optimization for scale. The platform is designed to feel familiar to users of legacy forums and imageboards while allowing administrators to tailor the experience to their community’s needs.

## Why Now?

The current technological and social environment is particularly well-suited for OpenBoard’s emergence. As large platforms face increasing scrutiny for data collection, user manipulation, and systemic bias, users are beginning to seek alternatives that restore trust and agency.

OpenBoard provides a meaningful and practical alternative. It allows users to build and moderate their communities without relying on a central authority. Its open-source model ensures transparency, and its design philosophy prioritizes long-term sustainability over short-term growth. In a time when control over digital spaces is increasingly contested, OpenBoard aims to give it back to the people who use them.

## Summary

OpenBoard is an open-source discussion platform built to empower communities with ownership over their digital spaces. It centers on privacy, modularity, and administrative control and enables discussion without compromising user autonomy. By enabling customizable, anonymous, and self-hosted boards, OpenBoard is rooted in openness, decentralization, self-governance, and free speech.

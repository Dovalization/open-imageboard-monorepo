# OpenBoard | API

This is the API that powers the platform. It is built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and serves as a backend for the OpenBoard frontend. The API is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration with other services and applications.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

By default, your server will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can use your favorite API platform like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test your APIs

## Requirements

You can check out the [API Requirements](./api-requirements.md) document for a detailed list of requirements and features that the API should support.
